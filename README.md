# Game-projects
My first steps in Game Development


## Rainers Schlupftag
My own project
<br>
As a birthday present, I put together a package of my first games made with Pygame. It contains a jump game, Snake and Hangman, which can be selected via a menu. A task is also set in the menu: To earn achievements in order to receive hints for the actual gift. 
When a certain score is reached in the games, the individual achievements are unlocked and can be viewed in the achievements menu. 
Each game has its own small menu for starting and displaying the score. 
I created the project in 5 days and unfortunately the last game was not finished in time, so only a text screen is displayed. 

## Dapper Dasher
Training GameDev
<br> My first experience with C++. Just another Runner Game with an implemented score where the Player has to jump over several hazards.
